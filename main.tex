%% Problems:
%% Special characters in the bibliography mostly work fine. However, for example, Bo{\v{s}}kovi{\'c}, {\v{Z}}eljko produces not the correct output (the entries are bovskovic2005locality and bovskovic2005left)

%% The entry jackendoff1977x produced not the desired result; there should be a bar on the top of the X (I also tried $\overline{X}$, but this doesn't work).

%% The line: 
%% \begin{theo}[A Note on \textsc{finish}, \textsc{through} and Perfective Aspect]\label{exkursfertigdurch}
%% does not produce small caps :( Maybe you can help :* :*

%% Example {bsp:advadvadvorderitalfrench} is very small; do you have an idea to make it more readable? :)
